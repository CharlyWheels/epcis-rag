# EPCIS-RAG

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on **synthetic EPCIS** data using **vLLM**.  
This project builds a supply chain assistant that can answer natural language questions about traceability events (shipments, receipts, lead times, etc.) while always citing the underlying evidence.

---

## âœ¨ Goal

- Generate a synthetic dataset of EPCIS events (ObjectEvent, AggregationEvent).
- Index events with embeddings for efficient retrieval (Chroma/FAISS).
- Serve RAG answers with vLLM, including citations to event/shipment IDs.
- Evaluate quality (EM/F1), retrieval (Recall@k), and performance (latency p50/p95).
